We are working on developing a generative AI model that predicts the probability of drugs being effective treatments for various diseases. Our first step is to identify the top 20 most prevalent diseases globally. Once identified, we will analyze and determine potential drugs that could be used as solutions for these diseases.

After identifying suitable drugs, we will forecast their market availability, closely monitoring their supply and demand. This will allow us to adjust production accordingly, ensuring that drug shortages are addressed while reducing excess production where there is surplus. Our goal is to optimize drug availability in response to real-time demand and supply conditions.
