# Generative AI for Drug Discovery and Demand Forecasting

we have done a drug discovery using GenAi and ml and the we analysed drug demand forecasting using ml.....now give me the brief readme for github"We are working on developing a generative AI model that predicts the probability of drugs being effective treatments for various diseases. Our first step is to identify the top 20 most prevalent diseases globally. Once identified, we will analyze and determine potential drugs that could be used as solutions for these diseases.

After identifying suitable drugs, we will forecast their market availability, closely monitoring their supply and demand. This will allow us to adjust production accordingly, ensuring that drug shortages are addressed while reducing excess production where there is surplus. Our goal is to optimize drug availability in response to real-time demand and supply conditions." brief of our project 
## Project Overview

This project leverages **Generative AI** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to enhance drug discovery and market forecasting. Our aim is to optimize drug availability and address supply and demand dynamics effectively.

### Objectives

1. **Drug Discovery with Generative AI:** 
   - Develop a generative AI model to predict the efficacy of potential drugs for various diseases.
   - Begin by identifying the top 20 most prevalent diseases globally.
   - Analyze and propose potential drugs that could effectively treat these diseases.

2. **Demand Forecasting and Market Analysis:**
   - Forecast the market availability of identified drugs.
   - Monitor supply and demand closely to adjust production levels.
   - Aim to minimize drug shortages and prevent overproduction, optimizing overall drug availability.

### Key Features

- **Generative AI Model:** Predicts drug efficacy based on disease profiles.
- **Disease Identification:** Focus on the 20 most prevalent global diseases.
- **Market Forecasting:** Analyzes and predicts drug demand and supply trends.
- **Production Optimization:** Adjusts drug production based on real-time data to address shortages and surpluses.
